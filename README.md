# smssending
A project that explains how to send sms to registrants on your website

Now, before you attempt to use this, you must have registered on a sms sending site and gotten their api. the api will have some variables 
that you must provide in your code before using/initalizing the api. 
Currently, im using ebulksms.com (which i'll use in this code). You can register with them and get your api key to use. :)
